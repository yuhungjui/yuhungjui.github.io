This research applies machine learning methods to study weather events associated with clouds and storms, with a focus on their three-dimensional structures and frequency.

By leveraging environmental variables and high-resolution data, the models capture how sub-scale cloud processes relate to large-scale atmospheric conditions. 

The approach provides new insights into how cloud-related weather events may change under future climate scenarios, advancing understanding at the weatherâ€“climate interface.
