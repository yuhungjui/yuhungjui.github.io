## Hungjui Yu Â∞§ËôπÂè°

I am a Atmospheric Scientist based in Fort Collins, Colorado, U.S.

## Research 

- **Cloud & Storm Structure** ‚Äì Unraveling the 3D features of clouds and storms.  
- **Mesoscale Convective Processes** ‚Äì Understanding the environmental controls on clouds and storms.  
- **Weather‚ÄìClimate Interface** ‚Äì Connecting short-term extremes with long-term climate trends.
- **Aviation** ‚Äì Building tools for cloud-related aviation applications.

<!-- I study the 3D structure of clouds and storms, blending atmospheric science and machine learning to reveal patterns that shape weather and climate, and to create tools that make aviation safer for professionals and the public alike. -->

## Tools

- **Data Integration and Analysis** ‚Äì Combining remote-sensing observations and numerical models.
- **Machine Learning** ‚Äì Extracting patterns and mechanisms within clouds and the environments.
- **Software Development** ‚Äì Creating scalable, open-source packages for research and applications.

<!-- My work explores the 3-dimensional structure of clouds and storms, the mesoscale convective and environmental processes that shape them, and their role at the weather‚Äìclimate interface.

I integrate environmental data analysis from remote-sensing observations and numerical models with machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and mechanisms within clouds and their environments. I also develop aviation-focused tools to better address and understand storm-related risks. -->

***"The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one."***

I integrate **remote-sensing observations**, **numerical modeling**, and **machine learning** to reveal the processes that shape storms in a changing environment.

My work advances **scientific understanding** while improving **operational safety**. Through rigorous science and scalable software tools, I transform complex atmospheric insights into practical solutions that strengthen safety, resilience, and decision-making for both professionals and the public in a changing atmosphere.
