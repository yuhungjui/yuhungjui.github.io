I am ***Hungjui Yu*** **(Â∞§ËôπÂè°)** ‚Äì a researcher in Atmospheric Science based in Fort Collins, Colorado.

## Research 

- **Cloud & Storm Structure** ‚Äì Unraveling the 3D organization of clouds and storms.  
- **Mesoscale Processes** ‚Äì Studying the environmental drivers of convective weather.  
- **Weather‚ÄìClimate Interface** ‚Äì Linking short-term weather patterns to longer-term changing climate.  

<!-- I study the 3D structure of clouds and storms, blending atmospheric science and machine learning to reveal patterns that shape weather and climate, and to create tools that make aviation safer for professionals and the public alike. -->

## Tools

- **Data Analysis** ‚Äì Combining remote-sensing observations and numerical models.
- **Machine Learning** ‚Äì Extracting patterns and mechanisms within clouds and their environments.  
- **Aviation** ‚Äì Cloud-Free Line-of-Sight (CFLOS) and lightning estimation.  

<!-- My work explores the 3-dimensional structure of clouds and storms, the mesoscale convective and environmental processes that shape them, and their role at the weather‚Äìclimate interface.

I integrate environmental data analysis from remote-sensing observations and numerical models with machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and mechanisms within clouds and their environments. I also develop aviation-focused tools to better address and understand storm-related risks. -->

I combine **remote-sensing observations**, **numerical modeling**, and **machine learning** to uncover the components that shape storms under changing environments. 

My research enhances both **scientific understanding** and **operational safety**. By combining rigorous science with scalable software tools, I translate complex atmospheric insights into practical solutions that enhance safety, resilience, and decision-making for both the public and professional communities in a changing atmosphere.
